 Docker Installation & First Container Demo (AWS EC2 – Ubuntu)

This demo explains how to install Docker on an Ubuntu EC2 instance, verify the installation, build a Docker image, run a container, and push the image to Docker Hub.

🔧 Step 1: Install Docker on Ubuntu EC2

Update the package index and install Docker:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y

▶️ Step 2: Start Docker Daemon

Docker commands will not work unless the Docker daemon is running.

Check Docker service status:

sudo systemctl status docker


If Docker is not running, start it:

sudo systemctl start docker


(Optional) Enable Docker to start on boot:

sudo systemctl enable docker

👤 Step 3: Grant Docker Access to User

By default, only root can run Docker commands.
To avoid using sudo every time, add the user to the Docker group.

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu


⚠️ Important: Logout and login again for the changes to take effect.

Verify group assignment:

groups

✅ Step 4: Verify Docker Installation

Run the official Docker test container:

docker run hello-world


Expected output:

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


If this works, Docker is installed and running correctly 🎉

📂 Step 5: Clone Demo Repository

Clone the demo repository and navigate into the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/dubbakanavya/docker_demo.git
cd docker_demo/examples

🔐 Step 6: Login to Docker Hub

Login using your Docker Hub credentials:

docker login


You will be prompted for:

Docker Hub Username

Docker Hub Password or Access Token

Successful login output:

Login Succeeded

🏗️ Step 7: Build Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:

docker build -t dubbakanavya/my-first-docker:latest .


This command:

Reads instructions from Dockerfile

Creates a Docker image

Tags it for Docker Hub

▶️ Step 8: Run Docker Container

Run the container from the built image:

docker run -it dubbakanavya/my-first-docker


Expected output:

Hello World


This confirms the container is running successfully.

📤 Step 9: Push Image to Docker Hub

Push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

docker push dubbakanavya/my-first-docker


Expected output:

Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/dubbakanavya/my-first-docker]
latest: digest: sha256:xxxx size: xxxx


The image is now publicly available on Docker Hub.
